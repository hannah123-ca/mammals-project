    <h2>Why Mammals Matter</h2>
    <p>Mammals are one of the most diverse and successful animal groups on Earth. From the tiny bumblebee bat to the massive blue whale, mammals have adapted to nearly every ecosystem. They share key traits: endothermy (warm-bloodedness), hair or fur, and the ability to nourish their young with milk.</p>

    <h2>Scientific Insights</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Recent research shows that mammals developed complex auditory and olfactory systems to survive in changing environments. Evolution shaped their senses to become tools for survival.
    </div>
    <p>Mammals have a highly developed brain — especially the neocortex, which allows reasoning, memory, and social behavior. Genomic studies help us trace back their origins and understand how diverse reproductive strategies (like marsupial pouches or placental births) evolved to suit different environments.</p>
    <p>Fossil records show that mammals first appeared around 200 million years ago during the late Triassic period. They coexisted with dinosaurs and thrived after the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, filling ecological niches that dinosaurs once held.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Surface</h2>
    <p>Monotremes like the platypus challenge what we think we know about mammals — they lay eggs! This shows evolution isn't about perfection, but adaptation. Learning about mammals isn't just learning facts — it's discovering the story of life adapting over millions of years.</p>
    <p>Mammals also show incredible social behaviors. Elephants grieve, whales sing complex songs, and primates use tools. This intelligence and empathy remind us of our connection to other species and the importance of conservation.</p>

    <h2>Student Voice & Connection</h2>
    <p>"What excites me most about mammals is how their biology reflects stories of survival and connection. Learning about them made me think deeply about empathy, conservation, and the intelligence of non-human species. This project helped me understand the science behind mammals — but also made me care more about protecting them."</p>
